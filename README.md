# Drainage Density Ruggedness (DDR)

Melton, 1957: the dimensionless product of drainage density (stream length per unit area â€“ km/km2) and total elevation relief.

Schumm, 1956: the difference between the highest and lowest points in the watershed, relative to watershed length (in km).

DDR is binned into 3 classes:

1. less than 2000 km/km2
2. 2000-4000
3. greater than 4000
 
Drainage density ruggedness indicates the potential for rapid runoff delivery to and through streams, which may contribute to harmful flood events (Patton and Baker, 1976).
